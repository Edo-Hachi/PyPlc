Complete interactive device placement system with visual vertical connections

## Major Features Added

### Interactive Device Placement System
- Implemented click-to-place functionality for all device types
- Added mouse-driven device selection and grid placement interface
- Created visual preview system with placement feedback (yellow=available, red=overwrite warning)
- Integrated automatic device address generation based on grid position

### Visual Vertical Connection Display
- Added LINK_UP/LINK_DOWN sprite rendering on grid intersections
- Implemented visual representation of vertical electrical connections
- Enhanced grid device drawing system to display all connection sprites
- Improved user interface clarity for vertical connection management

### Enhanced User Interface
- Complete mouse interaction system for device manipulation
- Visual device palette with mouse hover effects and selection feedback
- Grid placement preview system with real-time position calculation
- Integrated DEL device functionality for removing placed devices

### Device Management Enhancements
- Extended GridDevice drawing system to support LINK_UP/LINK_DOWN sprites
- Implemented comprehensive device placement validation and error handling
- Added automatic device address assignment for different device types (X, Y, T, C)
- Enhanced grid coordinate to pixel coordinate conversion for precise placement

## Technical Implementation

### Interactive Placement System
- `_handle_grid_placement()`: Core placement logic with device type validation
- `_generate_device_address()`: Automatic address generation based on position and type
- Enhanced `_handle_mouse_input()`: Dual-mode operation for palette selection and grid placement
- Visual preview system with `_draw_device_placement_preview()` integration

### Visual Enhancement
- Extended `_draw_grid_devices()` method to render LINK_UP/LINK_DOWN sprites
- Sprite-based visual representation for all vertical connection points
- Consistent 8x8 pixel sprite rendering at grid intersections
- Color-coded connection status display (future enhancement ready)

### User Experience Improvements
- Intuitive mouse-driven workflow: select device type â†’ click to place
- Visual feedback system for device placement validation
- Seamless integration with existing electrical continuity system
- Real-time grid preview with placement conflict detection

## Sprite Integration
- Successfully integrated LINK_UP (8,8), LINK_DOWN (16,8), and DEL (8,16) sprites
- Sprite cache system updated with new connection sprites
- Visual consistency maintained across all device types
- Grid-based sprite positioning for optimal alignment

## Circuit Construction Workflow
1. **Device Selection**: Use 1-8 keys or mouse clicks on device palette
2. **Visual Preview**: Hover over grid intersections for placement preview
3. **Device Placement**: Click on grid intersections to place selected device
4. **Vertical Connections**: Place LINK_UP and LINK_DOWN at same X coordinate for vertical electrical connection
5. **Device Removal**: Select DEL device and click on placed devices to remove

## System Integration
- Full compatibility with existing electrical continuity system
- Seamless operation with real-time power flow visualization
- Integration with grid-based electrical modeling
- Maintained backward compatibility with traditional ladder logic system

## User Interface Excellence
- Mouse cursor enabled for precise device placement
- Visual device palette with clear selection indicators
- Grid intersection targeting with pixel-perfect accuracy
- Real-time feedback for all user interactions

This implementation establishes a complete interactive PLC ladder diagram construction system with visual vertical connections, enabling users to build complex multi-rung circuits through intuitive mouse and keyboard operations.
