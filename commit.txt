Major refactoring: Unified device system with CSV specification compliance

5-Phase Device System Refactoring:

Phase 1: Sprite Name Unification
- Unified CDEV_NML â†’ OUTCOIL_NML across all modules
- Updated sprite cache in main.py with proper naming
- Synchronized config.py, grid_system.py, electrical_system.py

Phase 2: INCOIL (Input Coil) Implementation
- Added DeviceType.INCOIL to config.py
- Implemented INCOIL_ON/OFF sprite support in grid_system.py
- Added electrical logic for input coil processing
- Extended device palette to include input coil

Phase 3: TIMER 3-State System Enhancement
- Implemented TIMER_STANBY/CNTUP/ON state management
- Added timer logic with electrical power flow integration
- Enhanced GridDevice with timer state fields (timer_preset, timer_current, timer_state)
- Synchronized timer sprites with CSV specification

Phase 4: OUTCOIL_REV (Reverse Output Coil) Implementation
- Added DeviceType.OUTCOIL_REV with reverse logic operation
- Implemented coil_energized = not power_state for reverse operation
- Added OUTCOIL_REV_ON/OFF sprite support
- Extended electrical system with reverse coil synchronization

Phase 5: COUNTER System Enhancement
- Implemented COUNTER_ON/OFF sprite switching
- Added edge detection logic for counter increment
- Enhanced GridDevice with counter state management (counter_preset, counter_current, counter_state)
- Integrated counter logic into electrical power flow system

Technical Achievements:
- Extended device palette from 8 to 10 devices (1-0 keys)
- Maintained full electrical simulation with power flow visualization
- Complete CSV specification compliance for sprite naming
- Enhanced modular architecture with proper separation of concerns
- All existing functionality preserved with new device support

Files Modified:
- main.py: Sprite cache extension, device palette update
- config.py: New device type definitions
- grid_system.py: State management and sprite switching logic
- electrical_system.py: Device logic implementation and electrical simulation
- Device synchronization between grid system and PLC logic maintained
